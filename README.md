## Home Page [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#home-page)

On my website's home page, I aim to provide easy navigation through the use of a drop-down menu button, a clickable logo, and contact information, all integrated into our navigation bar. Additionally, to enhance the visual appeal of the website, we have included a large header image celebrating and symbolizing Sao Paulo Travel, which is our company's name. Finally, we have incorporated a simple div below the image to showcase the greatness of our company.

## Drop Down Menu[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#drop-down-menu)

<p style="text-align: center;">I applied javascript to make a toggle fucntion that could toggle the menu open and closed. Then at the bottom of the template tag I applied a v-if element to tell the navigationbar to appear if the menu has ben toggled on.</p>

```
const isMenuOpen = ref(false)

const toggleMenuOpen = () => {
  isMenuOpen.value = !isMenuOpen.value
}
<template>
  <NavigationBarMenu v-if="isMenuOpen" />
</template
```
